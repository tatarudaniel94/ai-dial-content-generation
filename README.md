# Image Generation and Analysis with DIAL API

A Python implementation task to work with AI image generation and analysis capabilities via DIAL API

## 🎓 Learning Goals

By completing these tasks, you will learn:
- How to generate images from text prompts using DALL-E 3
- How to analyze images using different AI models (GPT-4o, Claude-3-Sonnet)
- Two different approaches for handling images in AI systems:
   - **OpenAI approach**: Base64 encoding for direct embedding
   - **DIAL approach**: Bucket storage with attachment references
- How to work with file uploads, downloads with DIAL bucket
- How DIAL adapts requests for different AI model vendors

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- pip
- API key for DIAL service

## 🔧 Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set your API key:**
   - Ensure that you are connected to the EPAM VPN
   - Get the DIAL API key here: https://support.epam.com/ess?id=sc_cat_item&table=sc_cat_item&sys_id=910603f1c3789e907509583bb001310c
   - Update the `API_KEY` constant in `task/_utils/constants.py`
   - Get available models from: https://ai-proxy.lab.epam.com/openai/models

3. **Project structure:**

## 📝 Your Tasks

### If the task in the main branch is hard for you, then switch to the `with-detailed-description` branch

Complete the implementation of these three practice files:

### 1. **task_openai_itt.py** - OpenAI-Style Image Analysis
**Goal:** Analyze an image using base64 encoding approach
- Create DialModelClient with GPT-4o model (and other models)
- Encode image as base64 data URL
- Send ContentedMessage with text and image content
- **Key Learning:** Direct image embedding in messages

### 2. **task_dial_itt.py** - DIAL-Style Image Analysis
**Goal:** Analyze an image using bucket storage approach
- Upload image to DIAL bucket storage
- Create message with attachment reference
- Test with different AI models
- **Key Learning:** File storage and attachment handling

### 3. **task_tti.py** - Text-to-Image Generation
**Goal:** Generate images from text prompts
- Create text prompt for image generation
- Use DALL-E 3 model for generation
- Download and save generated images
- Experiment with `size`, `quality` and `style` of output via `custom_fields` configuration parameter
- **Key Learning:** AI image generation and file handling


## 🎯 Expected Outputs

### Text-to-Image Task
- Generated image file saved locally with timestamp
- Console output showing request/response details

### Image-to-Text Tasks
- AI description of the `dialx-banner.png` image
- Comparison between different models' responses

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
- **Empty API key:** Update `constants.py` with your DIAL API key
- **VPN connection:** Ensure EPAM VPN is active
- **File not found:** Verify `dialx-banner.png` exists in project root
- **Network errors:** Check DIAL service status and connectivity

## 🌟 Bonus Challenges

Once you complete the basic tasks, try these extensions:
1. **Multi-model comparison:** Run the same image analysis with different models
2. **Custom prompts:** Create your own text-to-image prompts
3. **Batch processing:** Analyze multiple images at once
4. **Error handling:** Add robust error handling and retries

## 📚 Key Concepts Covered

- **Multimodal AI:** Working with both text and images
- **API Design Patterns:** Different approaches to handle media content
- **Async Programming:** File operations and HTTP requests
- **Model Abstraction:** How DIAL Core adapts requests across vendors
- **File Management:** Upload, download, and storage operations
